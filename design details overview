👉 **System Design Expansion** — the parts reviewers / judges / professors usually want next:

• Deployment topology
• Cloud stack
• Data flow diagrams
• Security architecture
• Governance model
• MVP vs Phase-2
• Cost envelope
• Execution roadmap

Below is the **next-level design section** you should append to your document.

# 🔷 Deployment & Infrastructure Design

## Cloud Strategy

Hybrid-cloud with government compliance:

**Primary Cloud**

* Kubernetes (EKS / AKS / GKE equivalent for India region)
* Object storage for images/videos
* Managed PostgreSQL
* Managed vector DB
* CDN for rural acceleration

**Edge Layer**

* Regional edge nodes in Tier-2/3 cities
* Railway-station kiosks
* Disaster-relief vans
* NGO offices

**Networking**

* Private VPC for police systems
* Zero-trust gateway
* VPN tunnels to state police networks
* API firewall

# 🔷 Data Flow — Case Upload to Discovery

### Case Creation Flow

1. Family uploads photos + details
2. API Gateway validates + rate limits
3. Case Service stores metadata
4. Images → Object Storage
5. AI Service triggered by Kafka event
6. Face embeddings → Vector DB
7. OSINT crawler activated
8. Search index updated
9. Police verification requested
10. Public listing published

---

### Tip Processing Flow

1. Citizen submits tip
2. Tip Service stores submission
3. AI analyses media
4. Geo-clustering applied
5. Priority score calculated
6. Police dashboard updated
7. Alerts triggered if threshold crossed

---

# 🔷 Security Architecture

## Identity & Access

* OAuth2 + device fingerprinting
* Police smart-card login
* NGO role tokens
* RBAC + ABAC combined
* Session-level audit logging

---

## Data Protection

* AES-256 at rest
* TLS 1.3 in transit
* Separate biometric vault
* Key rotation via HSM
* Tokenization for public views

---

## Abuse Controls

* CAPTCHA + rate limits
* Duplicate case detection
* Sybil resistance
* Shadow banning
* Court-order unlock mechanism

---

# 🔷 Governance & Ethics Layer

Independent oversight board:

• Police
• Judiciary nominee
• Civil-rights group
• AI ethics council
• Data-protection officer

Responsibilities:

* Model audits
* Bias review
* False-positive analysis
* Transparency reports
* Retention approvals

---

# 🔷 MVP Scope (Year-1)

### Phase-1 Core

* Public case registry
* Photo uploads
* FIR verification
* Tip system
* Radius alerts
* Map view
* Police dashboard
* Vector face search
* Manual moderation
* Multilingual UI

### Excluded initially

* Social-media crawling
* Aadhaar gateway
* CCTV ingestion
* Age progression
* Disaster vans

---

# 🔷 Phase-2 (Year-2)

* OSINT crawling
* CCTV pilots
* Shelter scanning
* Railway feeds
* Age-progression GAN
* Offline kiosks
* NGO dashboards
* SMS gateway
* State federation

---

# 🔷 Phase-3 (National Scale)

* Border prediction
* Travel-corridor AI
* Interpol hooks
* Biometric deduplication
* Disaster rapid-deploy units
* Mobile vans
* Satellite imagery ingestion

---

# 🔷 Cost Envelope (Rough India-Scale)

### MVP (Pilot in 3 States)

₹8–12 crore/year

Includes:

* Cloud infra
* AI compute
* Dev team
* Police integration
* Security audits

### National Rollout

₹80–150 crore/year

Includes:

* Edge nodes
* CCTV ingestion
* Disaster hardware
* Oversight board
* 24×7 SOC

# 🔷 Execution Roadmap

| Quarter | Deliverable                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Q1      | Core APIs + case service     |
| Q2      | Police dashboard + AI search |
| Q3      | Alerts + mobile app          |
| Q4      | Pilot launch                 |
| Year 2  | OSINT + CCTV                 |
| Year 3  | Nationwide                   |

---

# 🔷 Threat Model Summary

| Threat        | Mitigation                |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| False cases   | FIR + duplicate detection |
| Doxxing       | Photo watermarking        |
| Bias          | Model audits              |
| Data leak     | HSM + encryption          |
| Deepfake tips | Media forensics           |

# 🔷 What This Gives Your Project

With this added, your document becomes:

✅ Research-grade
✅ Architect-level
✅ Grant-ready
✅ Government-proposal quality
